# -MNIST-handwritten-number-prediction
I completed a project on MNIST handwritten digit prediction and recognition using deep learning. By leveraging neural networks, I trained a model to accurately classify digits (0-9) from image data. This project enhanced my understanding of deep learning, image processing, and model optimization techniques.
